Thanks for taking the time to look at my blog.

To give a quick background, I am Mart - husband of one, father of one. I don't claim to be good at writing or to have the best ideas in the world, but this is where I write about the things I think about. If I do it enough, I should get better, so be patient.

You know those blogs where people write about one thing, their passion, their career, their hobby? Well this isn't one of those blogs. It might become that one day, but I like lots of things - some you might find interesting, and some that might bore you to tears.

What ever you have seen on this blog, I hope you enjoyed it.
