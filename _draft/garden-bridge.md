I was recently walking along London’s South bank, and I reached a tree lined section that is a universally pleasant place to spend time. To my horror, there were posters on all the trees to inform people that they are earmarked to be removed to make way for the [Garden Bridge](https://www.gardenbridge.london/), which it suggested was a ‘vanity project’. Whether or not I agree with this sentiment, the phrase stuck with me as I felt it could be applied to this blog. Is this my own vanity project? Let me explain.

Why do I need a blog? I mean, the only reason you are likely read this post is if you are in my select group of three people (my wife, my sister, and my friend Patrick) whom I’ve told about these ramblings. I’m not actively putting it out there, so to speak, and the subject matter covered on here could be kindly described as ‘varied’. Am I hoping that the world stumbles upon a post and boom, I’ve gone viral, etc? No. Even with the tiny potential audience and the even tinier actual audience, I’m ensuring that I keep a completely sensation free level of content with the closest sighting of controversy or originality a long way off.

I make decisions about how my largely non-existent audience might perceive my subject choices. For example, [last week I wrote something about my GoPro](http://www.dawsneyland.com/blog/the-abandoned-gopro/). Then this week, my Niece got a GoPro for her birthday and hasn’t a clue where to start with it. I thought I could write a blog post on my top five starter tips, based on my own experience, and this might even help her and maybe, just maybe, might help others, but – wait!!!! I wrote a GoPro post last week, and what would the one person who bothered to read it think if they read another one with a similar topic the very next week (thanks Google Analytics – you’re really crunching those numbers, I mean, number). Screw family loyalty – what about my audience?!

Ridiculous, eh? 

So am I telling myself fibs? Is the fact that I am considering what an audience might think, point to the fact that I want more eyes on this? Well, maybe it does. The truth is I am not sure. Obviously something is going on in my subconscious and it would appear that I’m using this post as some kind of therapy session to draw it out. There are reasons why this is probably not a vanity project.

## Discovery
These posts are not discoverable. I do not add tags and optimise the posts for search. I’ve set up social media accounts under the name of the website, but I haven’t used them. I will not be tweeting a link to this post. I will not be emailing it to my subscribers. I will not be enabling the comments on any of these posts. But I will check Google Analytics once a week and see if anyone has read an article, and I will be slightly disappointed when the numbers are in single figures. What am I expecting? I’m making anything I write incredibly difficult to find. To demonstrate this, let’s take my last post, ‘The abandoned GoPro’. I typed this in to Google and plenty of results appear, but none pointing to my post. Only when I add ‘Dawsneyland’ to the search do I appear in the search results. And let’s face it, no-one is going to do that.

## Fears
I am scared of what people will think. If people I work with found these posts, they would laugh. If my friends saw it they would probably be ok. When I’ve told my family, they’ve been supportive and encouraging. I’ve put my picture on this website, so I’m identifiable, but whilst I do not use search engine optimisation or social media, I can stay hidden without ever having to be judged by people who don’t care about me. But my biggest fear is the reality. Perhaps I’m not that good at this, or I’m not going to get any better. It’s entirely possible that however much I want to be good at telling stories, it might be beyond me. 

## Anonymity
If this is a vanity project, then presumably I would have just used my full name dot com. I want a web presence without anyone knowing it’s me. I want to make videos without being in them. I shudder at the sound of my own voice. Anonymity is certainly where those statements seem to point to, but it also is a thorn in my side too. 

This website is not so much my Garden Bridge, but more like my soft play area. I can try things out, without too much fear of hurting myself or others. I want to write posts, articles. I want to mess around with the design of the website. I want to figure out how much of me that I want to share. I did a post about pictures that my son took which I enjoyed writing but I can’t imagine many other people would have been interested in it, because I don’t think I told the story very well. But that’s ok because at least I wrote something which is half the battle. I started this blog because I wanted to stop procrastinating and actually get a side project off the ground. And I think it’s valid as somewhere to learn about myself, what I’m capable of and what my weaknesses are. But equally, I might want to start thinking about what I want to do when I do decide to step in front of the camera, show who I am and let my voice be heard.
