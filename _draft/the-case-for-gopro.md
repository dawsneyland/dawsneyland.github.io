GoPro – this word is to action cameras, what Hoover is to vacuum cleaners. I remember when I first heard of a GoPro. It must have been 2 years ago whilst watching something on YouTube. Very quickly after realising that they exist, I was all over Amazon checking out prices, options, reading buyers comments. My conclusion was the question ‘Why would you spend over £300 on something so lacking in features?’. Needless to say, I now own one!

I’m a bit of a sucker for a gadget, however I’m not someone who commits to spending money spontaneously on things that I basically don’t need. My initial introduction to the GoPro came about because I wanted to buy a new camera. A point-and-shoot. My current camera at the time was a Samsung Galaxy S4, which was and still is in fact a smartphone. The integrated cameras of smartphones have improved in quality so much however they will never beat a half decent compact camera, so I set about looking for one to buy and during this process I stumbled upon the GoPro. I quickly established that for a rather hefty price tag, you got no image stabilisation, a small sensor, no zoom, fisheye effect. It didn’t seem like value for money. I needed something more versatile, and so the GoPro disappeared from my consciousness, never to return, or so I thought.

Fast forward a year, and I am the proud owner of a Sony RX100. A lovely camera with a 1-inch sensor, small zoom, full manual control, and thanks to my patience and determination, I secured it when the price dipped considerably online. Wonderful. With this new camera, I am taking lots of photos and even more video that ever before. I’m making family videos, and I have a bit of birthday money and an imminent holiday with the whole family to somewhere with a waterpark. Hello GoPro! I can now justify it as I have some ‘frivolous’ money to spend and a reason to ‘need’ it. And again, I wait in the shadows of Amazon waiting for a dip in price, pouncing when it inevitably happens. Sidenote: if you don’t need something the next day, you can take advantage of price fluctuations incredibly easily.

It’s easy to stack up the reasons I should have not committed my cash to such a thing. These wonderfully tiny items are marketed at people who I most certainly am not. Surfers. Snowboarders. BMX stunt dudes. Fools who climb rock faces with only a thin rope to catch them should things get a bit slippy. To boot, all these people tend to be young and quite beautiful in a Point Break kind of way! I am not any of these people. Do I secretly want to be these people? No. Am I planning on taking any of these hobbies up and accepting the fact I’m not beautiful? No. Could I see myself buying one and it sitting gathering dust on my shelf for months on end? Yes.

So why did I get one? Well, I definitely wanted something that was waterproof and a little bit rugged. They also have a great timelapse and nightlapse feature, although admittedly I haven’t used either yet. But with these items, it isn’t so much about using them all the time; they are specialist tools at your disposal for when you need them. I went to a waterpark with my whole family and got some amazing footage over a few days. Under water, going down water slides, group photos, and I made a video built solely from all the GoPro footage. The quality exceeded my expectations. The GoPro has sat on a shelf since this holiday for the best part of five months, and sometimes I think ‘Well, that was a waste of money’. But it doesn’t matter how long it sits on the shelf. I’m going on holiday again soon, to the coast, and I’ll take it with me along with all the accessories. And the footage will be great. 

Would I like to have the opportunity to use it more than I do? Of course, I mean, who wouldn’t?! But when the opportunities do come my way, I’ll take them. And my GoPro.
