Recently I was able to start something I had been meaning to do for months - Camera Club! My Nephew received a camera for Christmas, and along with my Father-in-law, we had been looking for an opportunity to just take our cameras out, and snap away. It's not always easy finding a time that everyone is available, and so one of the first opportunities to do this was in May, on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Our garden was full of bluebells in bloom so we choose that as our subject matter.

It soon transpired that we had an unexpected member of camera club - my 4-year-old son Dylan. I guess it wasn't too much of a surprise that he wanted to join us. He adores everyone in the family, but when the men are doing something, he always wants to join in with that. I poured over the club rules and determined that he was allowed to join us, so my wife dug out her camera, gave him a quick tutorial, and he was off. Let's see the results.

When I was copying the pictures off the memory card, I had a look at the times. He took his first picture at 16:25 and the last 18 minutes later. In that time, he took 290 pictures. 290. 16 every minute, or one every four seconds. And for the record, my wifes camera didn't have continuous shooting so one press of the shutter equals one picture. He didn't have that camera for long before the battery gave up, but all the time that it was in his hands, he was going for it!

Initially there were quite a few of these pictures. Waists and wrists.

But it wasn't long before he started choosing subjects. Bottom line, pick something to take a picture of and get it in the frame. As a four-year-old that's a pretty good objective initially.

He got a little help from his Cousin...

...and whilst doing so, he captured some nice shadows of them both.

Getting a bit more adventurous, it wasn't long before he was picking things out that he liked the look of.

The resulting picture of a plane is not going to win any awards anytime soon, but it demonstrates a level of control, and he was definitely aiming for that. Now I just need to show him where the zoom control is.

I'm not that keen on pictures of myself, but I quite like this one that he took off me.

I'll spare you the other 284 pictures, after all whether you're 4 or 40, don't you just select the best of the batch anyway?! 

Of course, there has been an element of post production on the pictures but only at the most basic level. Increasing the contrast where necessary, and I've compressed them to a level that will allow them to load efficiently. Dylan has not got that in his armoury yet. Perhaps I'll introduce him to Adobe next...

I will definitely be including Dylan in future camera club outings. He took some great pictures and it was such a lovely experience to review the pictures he took on the day. It gave a tiny glimpse of the world through his eyes. Well, 290 glimpses in 18 minutes. 

(Cue cheesy ending) Most of all, he enjoyed it, felt like he was doing the same as us and his results were just as good. I thought he might learn something from the experience, and no doubt he did, but he certainly taught me a thing or two, and I'll treasure that.
