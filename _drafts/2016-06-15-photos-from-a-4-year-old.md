When I'm not procrastinating about the finer details of this blog, I have another blog that I post to on a semi-regular basis, and the sole purpose of that blog is to post links to the family videos that I make. 

A Sunday afternoon in May, and the start of something I had been meaning to do for months - Camera Club!
