On a Sunday afternoon in May, I was able to start something I had been meaning to do for months - Camera Club! My Nephew received a camera for Christmas, and asking with my Father-in-law, we had been looking for an opportunity to just take our cameras out, and snap away. It's not always easy finding a time that everyone is available, and so one of the first opportunities to do this was in May, on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Our garden was full of bluebells in bloom so we choose that as our subject matter.

It soon transpired that we had an unexpected member of camera club - my 4-year-old son Dylan. I guess it wasn't too much of a surprise that he wanted to join us. He adores everyone in the family, but when the men are doing something, he wants to do that too. 
I poured over the club rules and determined that he was allowed to join us, so my wife got her camera out, gave him a quick tutorial, and he was off. Let's see the results.

When I was getting the pictures off the memory card, I had a look at the times. He took his first picture at 16:25 and the last 18 minutes later. In that time, he took 290 pictures. 290. 16 every minute, or one every four seconds. And for the record, my wifes camera didn't have continuous shooting so one press of the shutter equals one picture.
