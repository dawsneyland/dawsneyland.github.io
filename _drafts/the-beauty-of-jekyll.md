title: "The Beauty of Jekyll"
---

A brief history of my web design experience... at the turn of the millenium I had a Geocities site. Four years later I was posting regularly to Blogger. Wordpress caught my attention shortly after that, but then I entered an online wilderness... until now. The reason for this on-off relationship being back on, is Jekyll!

##What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a Static Site Generator.

##What's wrong with Wordpress?
Firstly, there's nothing wrong with Wordpress. I'm a massive fan of the most popular CMS on the web, and aside from this website, I have another website that I post to regularly and it is powered entirely by Wordpress. But it's not the only kid on the block. There are times that I've wanted to switch this site to WordPress site because it's so damn easy to get content out there. But that's one of the reasons I want to try other things. Wordpress almost allows you to publish content before you've really thought about what you want. Whilst everything takes me a bit longer on Jekyll, I have to make more conscious decisions about what content I want to publish and how i want pages to look, and once I've made these decisions I have the ability to get exactly what I want, rather than what a theme will offer me. The only caveat is that I have to code it myself. 

##Great, so why isn't every site made using Jekyll?
Because Jekyll has limitations. You will not be able to have any dynamic content for example, unless you shoehorn it in using JavaScript. Also, not everyone can code, and even if they can, they might not want to. It's a bit like homemade pasta; it takes much longer and tastes just as good as if you picked it up off the shelf in the supermarket!

##Why are **you** using Jekyll?
I really like coding, and I don't get the opportunity to code these days. If you want to code, you need a project to work on and a personal website is a pretty good example of that. Jekyll allows me to scratch the coding itch that I have, and I can choose how far I want to go with it. I can access my code anywhere by managing it all through Github Pages, which will also host my site for free whilst it stays below a certain size. 





I'm very new to the web design world. My interest in it goes way back to when you could get a Geocities site, and I messed around with that but I abandoned it almost as soon as I started. I wrote a website for potential business and was pretty pleased with the results but when my interest in the business subsided, so did my interest in the website that accompanied it. 

Shortly after that, I heard a new word - blog. In 2004 it was **the** word, and it coincided with me working abroad and 
travelling, so the perfect opportunity to share stories and pictures of my travels with family and friends back home. 
This captured my imagination a lot more, and I kept on blogging here for over a year, until I no longer had a reason to share.

And that is where my online presence took a decade long hiatus. 

I don't think that I've been any less interested in web design, but life has thrown many balls my way - some good, some bad and my mind hasn't always been able to cope. I like writing, even if I'm not particularly good at it, and last year I thought that maybe I had some room in my life to get back in to this geeky pleasure.

In the ten years that I haven't been paying attention, the world of web design and blogging has moved on considerably, but the reasons to blog haven't.

I first heard about Wordpress a number of years ago, and liked the idea of it. So I started
