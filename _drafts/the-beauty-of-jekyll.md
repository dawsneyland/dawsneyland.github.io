title: "The Beauty of Jekyll"
---

A brief history of my web design experience... at the turn of the millenium I had a Geocities site. Four years later I was posting regularly to Blogger. Wordpress caught my attention shortly after that, but then I entered an online wilderness... until now. The reason for this on-off relationship being back on, is Jekyll!

##What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a Static Site Generator.

##What's wrong with Wordpress?
There's nothing wrong with Wordpress. 


I'm very new to the web design world. My interest in it goes way back to when you could get a Geocities site, and I messed around with that but I abandoned it almost as soon as I started. I wrote a website for potential business and was pretty pleased with the results but when my interest in the business subsided, so did my interest in the website that accompanied it. 

Shortly after that, I heard a new word - blog. In 2004 it was **the** word, and it coincided with me working abroad and 
travelling, so the perfect opportunity to share stories and pictures of my travels with family and friends back home. 
This captured my imagination a lot more, and I kept on blogging here for over a year, until I no longer had a reason to share.

And that is where my online presence took a decade long hiatus. 

I don't think that I've been any less interested in web design, but life has thrown many balls my way - some good, some bad and my mind hasn't always been able to cope. I like writing, even if I'm not particularly good at it, and last year I thought that maybe I had some room in my life to get back in to this geeky pleasure.

In the ten years that I haven't been paying attention, the world of web design and blogging has moved on considerably, but the reasons to blog haven't. 


What's the problem with Wordpress?
I first heard about Wordpress a number of years ago, and liked the idea of it. So I started
